        <h2>Creator</h2>
        <p>
            This project was created by me, <a href="https://mattbierner.com">Matt Bierner</a>. I've been on the VS Code team since 2016, primary working on VS Code's JavaScript and TypeScript support but also working extensively on VS Code's extension APIs and also touch a number of other areas of the product.
        </p>
        <p>
            I created Code 20/20 to share some of knowledge and tricks I use everyday while working in and on VS Code. VS Code is a very deep product and much of this depth is not immediately obvious. I want to help people discover more of the cool features that the VS Code team and community have implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Code 20/20, you can be sure the content was created by someone who generally knows what they are talking about. My goal is to teach you quickly and efficiently without the gimmicks and other BS that plague so many other coding resources.
