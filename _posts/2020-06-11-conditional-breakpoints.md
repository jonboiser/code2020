Conditional breakpoints are only hit when a given expression is true. They are useful when debugging loops or complex stateful code.

Create one by right clicking an existing breakpoint or in the gutter to 'add conditional breakpoint'. They are supported by VS Code's built-in JavaScript and TypeScript debugger. Extensions can add support for conditional breakpoints while debugging additional languages such as C++, C#,  or Java.
